EncryptSave

Turning this off will allow the game to save the raw data, rather than the compressed encrypted data
This along with DecryptLoad should always be kept on
If turned off, old saves will no longer work and new save files will be quite big
This and DecryptLoad should only be turned off for debugging purposes such as comparing raw save files
However, no matter what these are set to, JSON saving/loading will still work

0 : Game will save unencrypted uncompressed raw save files
1 (default): Game will save compressed encrypted save files
---------------
DecryptLoad
